ContentManagerDjango
ContentManagerDjango is a Django-based content management system designed as a simple yet efficient blog platform. This project enables users to create and manage blog posts while supporting various content formats, including programming files, images, audio, and video.

Project Structure:
Admin Panel: Built using Django's admin interface, this section serves as the backend for managing blog entries and uploading associated files.
Frontend: The project provides two main pages for content display:
Blog Listing Page: A page where all published blog posts are displayed.
Blog Detail Page: A dedicated page for viewing the full content of each blog post, including embedded files and media.
This project leverages Djangoâ€™s powerful features to ensure seamless content management and an intuitive user experience.


Installation & Setup
No additional packages are required for this project. The only prerequisite is having Django installed. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

Django Requires Python
```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, you will get a result with the version number, like this
```bash
Python 3.9.2
```

To install Django, you must use a package manager like PIP
To check if your system has PIP installed, run this command in the command prompt:
```bash
pip --version
```
Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Type the following in the command prompt, remember to navigate to where you want to create your project
```bash
py -m venv venv
```

Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

```

Install Django (if not already installed):

```bash
py -m pip install Django
```

Check Django Version
```bash
django-admin --version
```




**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/hameddalvand67/ContentManagerDjango.git]
```
Navigate to the ContentManagerDjango folder 
```
cd ContentManagerDjango
```
Migrate
Now when we have described a Model in the models.py file, we must run a command to actually create the table in the database.
Run database migrations:
```bash
py manage.py makemigrations
```

Run database migrate:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
Create a superuser (for accessing the admin panel):

```bash

python manage.py createsuperuser

```
Follow the prompts to set up a username and password.

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Access the application:
```
Admin Panel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
Blog Listing: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Now the project is fully set up and ready to use! ðŸš€
